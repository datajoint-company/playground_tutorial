These notebooks are oranized with numbers to highlight what should come next. First, we'll walk through the startup process. Next, you'll see an introduction to DataJoint, and how to structure a data pipeline. The Calcium Imaging and Electrophysiology folders show example data structures and analysis techniques from common experimental techniques. We've included some fill-in-the-blank sections for you to code yourself. If you want to see completed notebooks, see the folder of completed exercises.\n",
